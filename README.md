This is just a working template for an app using:
- Python backend with FastAPI
- Vue 3 using Vite
- PostgreSQL database

As I find myself using this stack pretty often, I figured it would make things easier to have a template ready for whenever I need it.

It works fine on Windows 10 with Docker Desktop, I haven't try on other environments.

It is designed for development, there are things to change for production (hot reload & stuff).

Feel free to give feedbacks if you use it, as I am just an amateur when it comes to Docker.
